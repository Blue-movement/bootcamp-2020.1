# Linked Lists, Stacks & Queues

## Intro

- Before you start working, make sure the filename is in format:
  - (i.e. firstName-lastName.py)

## Prompt(s)
- Given two numbers represented by two linked lists, write a function that returns sum list. The sum list is linked list representation of addition of two input numbers.
```
  - Example: 
  Input:
    L1 = 5 -> 6 -> 3 -> NULL
    L2 = 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> NULL
  Output: 1 -> 4 -> 0 -> 5 -> NULL
  ```
- Given a Linked List which represents a sentence S such that each node represents a letter, the task is to reverse the sentence without reversing individual words.
```
  - Example: 
  > Input:  I-> ->l->o->v->e-> ->G->e->e->k->s-> ->f->o->r-> ->G->e->e->k->s->NULL
  > Output: G->e->e->k->s-> ->f->o->r-> ->G->e->e->k->s-> ->l->o->v->e-> ->I->NULL
```
